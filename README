Generate good enough, easy to remember passwords from phrases.
````

Passphrase uses [Markov chains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)
modeled from any text file to generate easy to remember passwords.

Deterministic passwords are generated from a phrase by using a cryptographic
SHA1 hash of the phrase to navigate through the chain, instead of random
probabilities.

Using Markov chains makes the passwords pronounceable, and yet not be 
exact dictionary words. Password strength, length, and characters can 
be controlled through options. 

Though passwords generated may not be cryptographically strong, they 
are good enough. It gived a good enough password that can be remembered.
It is somewhere in between easy passwords that are based on dictionary 
words and difficult ones that are often written down on a piece of paper. 


Passphrase is structured like a python package, but not yet registered as one. Set `PYTHONPATH` to the `passphrase` folder and run `bin/phrasepw.py` to try it out.

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --website WEBSITE     website for which to create password
  --id ID               login id on the website
  --length LENGTH       length of password required
  --ease {0,1,2,3,4,5}  how easy should it be
  --case {1,2,3}        1: uppercase, 2: lowercase, 3: mixed case
  --numeric             whether to include numbers
  --special             whether to include special characters
  
Note: optional arguments website and id are used along with phrase
to make passwords unique. If supplied, the generated password will
be different for every combination of id and website, even with the
